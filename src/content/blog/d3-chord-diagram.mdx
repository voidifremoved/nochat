import ChordDiagram from '../../components/ChordDiagram.astro';

export const matrix = [
  [11975,  5871, 8916, 2868],
  [ 1951, 10048, 2060, 6171],
  [ 8010, 16145, 8090, 8045],
  [ 1013,   990,  940, 6907]
];

export const names = ["Group A", "Group B", "Group C", "Group D"];
export const colors = ["#444444", "#FFDD89", "#957244", "#F26223"];

This post demonstrates how to integrate a D3 chord diagram into an Astro blog post.

## The Chord Diagram

Below is a chord diagram visualizing the relationships between four groups.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  <ChordDiagram matrix={matrix} names={names} colors={colors} />
</div>

## How it works

The diagram is rendered using D3.js inside an Astro component. The data represents a matrix of flows between the groups. The chord diagram shows the inter-relationships between data points.
