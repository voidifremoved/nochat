This is the beginning of something new.

After clearing out the old experiments that once lived here, this site has been rebuilt from the ground up as a clean, minimal blog. It is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme, deployed automatically to GitHub Pages whenever a change is pushed.

## What to expect

Posts here will cover a range of topics -- whatever seems interesting or worth writing about at the time. Could be technical deep-dives, short notes, or longer essays.

Stay tuned.
